## <div class="text-blue mb-2"> About me </div>
Hello there! My name is Oscar Aguilar, I'm originally form [Peru](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=-lLEXvCiEsK4tAb1kYroDQ&q=peru+map&oq=peru+map&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BQgAEIMBUPcDWNsNYJgRaABwAHgAgAFJiAH6A5IBATiYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjwh4_Z8sDpAhVCHM0KHfWIAt0Q4dUDCAg&uact=5). I moved to the US in 2006, since then I lived in a couple of different states. I received a B.S. and a master's in applied statistics from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) in 2013. Also I recieved a PhD in statistics with minor in mathematics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) in 2019. Since 2015 I have been teaching and helping local professionals to solve their business problems using analytical methodology in Des Moines metropolitan area.

I'm a senior analytics consultant at [Principal](https://www.principal.com/) and a assitant professor of analytics at [Grand View University](https://www.grandview.edu/). I really enjoy my jobs because I have the chance to talk about different methodology/algorithms in the different classes that I teach, and I also get the opportunity to impletment them and see how they perform in real-life. 


## Areas of Interest
I'm passionate about solving real-life problem with data and algorithms. I'm interested in applied statistics, quantitative finance, applied machine learning, and consulting. The following are projects that I'm developing.

## Fun Activities
Besides teaching and office work, I really enjoy watching mafia related movies/shows and traveling to different countries with my family.
